Smart Recipe App 
This app will help people to make recipe on basis of existing integraients or they can take photo of recipe and app will suggest what type of this recipe 
And how it can be prepared.
  To build this app I need to train models for different type of combination of recipes.
Also images of recipe need to be trained.

There is no code written yet , I need to do from scratch.
From Google I need help for train models.
It's required near about 4to5 months to complete.

Will update this cover letter for timeline and release plan in phases.


About me: 
 I am professional Android App Developer having 9 years of exp in app development.

Will update about myself after some time :-)

Thanks
Sajid Shaikh
