Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include: 
(1) any potential sample code you’ve already written, 
(2) a list of the ways you could use Google’s help, 
(3) as well as the timeline on how you plan on bringing it to life by May 1, 2020.
